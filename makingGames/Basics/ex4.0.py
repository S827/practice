When I wrote this program the first time I had a mistake, and Python told me about it like this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module>
average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined
Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and explain why.
'''

print("In line 8, you have used the unknow variable which is car_pool_capacity instead of carpool_capacity")

'''
1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if itâ€™s just 4?
'''
print("Nothing specific will happen, it will just show carpool_Capacity as 120 not 120.0, other than that no changes will occur in the program. But yes, floating point numbers are used for more accurate computations.")
